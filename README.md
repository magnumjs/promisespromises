This repo contains the slides and examples covered in the [Async talk (9 February, 2012)](http://asyncjs.com/promises/) about JavaScript promises.

The examples relate closely to the wrappers found in [jQuery.promises](https://github.com/dharmafly/jquery.promises) scripts.

# Promise libraries #

- [jQuery.promises](https://github.com/dharmafly/jquery.promises) (A collection of little scripts that use jQuery.Deferred for cleaner, encapsulated flow control. Feature an Image and Timer wrapper.)
- [q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q) (Promise library for JavaScript)
- [q with jQuery](https://github.com/kriskowal/q/wiki/jQuery) (Using q and jQuery together)
- [when.js](https://github.com/briancavalier/when.js) (Another promise JavaScript library)
- [node-promise](https://github.com/kriszyp/node-promise) (Promise library for Node)
- [futures](https://github.com/coolaj86/futures) (Flow control library which offers promise functionality)
- [promise.io](https://github.com/kriszyp/promised-io) (Notable for file I/O)
- [jQuery](http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/) (jQuery's standard methods like Ajax return a promise)
